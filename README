I googled "list comprehension," and Google asked if I was "up for a challenge," i.e. the Google Foobar Challenge at https://www.google.com/foobar/.

I had a few hours of free time because I was nursing our ultra-low temperature STM (it was super quiet at 1.67 Kelvin!), so I tried a few of their puzzles.  They're fun but easy... well at least the first two levels - I haven't tried the third level yet.

Maybe when I have time, I will do a few more...
